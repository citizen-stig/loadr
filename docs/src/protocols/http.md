# HTTP

The HTTP client is built directly on hyper with a custom connection layer so
**every phase of every request is measured** — no averaged guesses:

| Metric | Phase |
|---|---|
| `http_req_blocked` | waiting for a connection (dns + connect + tls on cold connections; ~0 on reuse) |
| `http_req_connecting` | TCP connect |
| `http_req_tls_handshaking` | TLS handshake |
| `http_req_sending` | writing the request |
| `http_req_waiting` | time to first byte (TTFB) |
| `http_req_receiving` | reading the body |
| `http_req_duration` | sending + waiting + receiving |

Plus `http_reqs`, `http_req_failed` (transport error or status ≥ 400),
`data_sent`, `data_received`. Samples carry `name`, `method`, `status`,
`scenario`, `group`, `proto` tags.

## Versions

`defaults.http.version`:

- `auto` (default) — ALPN negotiation; HTTP/2 when the server offers it.
- `http1` — force HTTP/1.1.
- `http2` — offer only h2 over TLS.
- `http2-prior-knowledge` — HTTP/2 without negotiation, including plaintext.

HTTP/2 connections are multiplexed; HTTP/1.1 connections are kept alive and
reused **per VU** (a VU models one user agent: its own connections and cookie
jar). `keep_alive: false` closes after each request.

## TLS & mTLS

```yaml
defaults:
  http:
    tls:
      ca_file: ./internal-ca.pem        # extra trust roots (PEM, may contain several)
      cert_file: ./client.pem           # client certificate (mTLS)
      key_file: ./client-key.pem
      server_name: api.internal         # SNI override
      insecure_skip_verify: false       # accept any cert (testing only!)
      min_version: "1.2"                # pin the lowest TLS version offered
      max_version: "1.3"                # pin the highest TLS version offered
```

Roots default to the bundled Mozilla store (webpki-roots). Everything is
rustls — no OpenSSL dependency.

### TLS version pinning

`tls.min_version` and `tls.max_version` constrain which TLS versions the
handshake may negotiate. Both are strings and accept only `"1.2"` or `"1.3"`
(the `1.` prefix and a `TLSv1.` prefix are both tolerated, so `"TLSv1.3"`
works too). When neither is set the client offers TLS 1.2 and 1.3 and lets the
server pick the highest.

```yaml
defaults:
  http:
    tls:
      min_version: "1.3"     # refuse anything older than TLS 1.3
```

Pinning is useful for proving a server has dropped legacy TLS, or for forcing a
specific version while profiling. A configuration whose `min_version` is higher
than its `max_version` (so no version remains) is rejected at startup.

## Redirects, compression, proxies

- Redirects followed by default (`max_redirects: 10`); 301/302/303 switch to
  GET, 307/308 preserve method and body. Timings accumulate across hops; the
  reported `url` is the final one.
- `compression: true` sends `Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br` and
  transparently decompresses. `data_received` counts wire (compressed) bytes.
- `proxy: http://host:3128` routes plaintext requests via absolute-form and
  HTTPS via `CONNECT`.

## Cookies

Automatic per-VU jars (RFC 6265 domain/path/secure/expiry matching) — see
[Requests](../yaml/requests.md#cookies).

## Response caching

`cache: true` gives each VU a browser-style HTTP cache, modelled on JMeter's
HTTP Cache Manager. Only `GET` requests are cached, and only when the response
says so:

```yaml
defaults:
  http:
    cache: true
```

The cache key is the full request URL. Behaviour per GET:

- **Fresh hit** — if a stored entry is still within its `max-age`, it is served
  straight from cache with **no network round trip**. Timings are zero and
  `bytes_sent` is `0`.
- **Revalidation** — if an entry has expired but carries a validator (`ETag`
  and/or `Last-Modified`), loadr re-requests it with `If-None-Match` /
  `If-Modified-Since`. A **`304 Not Modified`** serves the cached body and
  refreshes its freshness window; the response timings/bytes reflect the
  conditional request.
- **Store** — a `200 OK` whose `Cache-Control` allows caching (a `max-age=N`
  and no `no-store`/`private`) is stored for next time.

`Cache-Control: no-store` or `private` are never cached. Responses without a
`max-age` are not stored. The cache lives in the VU and is not shared between
VUs, so the first iteration of each VU populates it.

Each served response carries a `cache` field in its `extras` set to `hit`,
`revalidated`, or `miss`, which is handy when inspecting traffic with
`--http-debug`.

## Per-host connection overrides

`hosts` pins one or more hostnames to fixed addresses, bypassing DNS — the
equivalent of curl's `--resolve`. Use it to send
traffic at a specific node behind a load balancer, to test before DNS has
propagated, or to hit a staging box while keeping the real `Host` header.

```yaml
defaults:
  http:
    hosts:
      api.example.com: 10.0.0.42          # host          -> ip
      api.example.com:443: 10.0.0.42:8443 # host:port      -> ip:port
      cdn.example.com: 10.0.0.43:8080     # host          -> ip:port
```

Keys are matched case-insensitively. A `host:port` key matches only requests to
that exact port; a bare `host` key matches any port. When the mapped value omits
a port, the request's original port is kept. Only connection routing changes —
the URL, `Host` header, SNI and certificate validation all still use the
original hostname.

## Discarding response bodies

`discard_response_bodies: true` drops each response body as soon as it has been
read and measured. This keeps memory flat during high-throughput or long
soak runs where bodies would otherwise pile up.

```yaml
defaults:
  http:
    discard_response_bodies: true
```

Discarding happens **after** the body is fully received and decompressed, so
`data_received` and all phase timings stay accurate. Extractors and body
assertions that run on a discarded response see an empty body, so only enable
this when you are asserting on status/headers/timings rather than body content.

## Distributed tracing

`tracing: true` injects a W3C Trace Context `traceparent` header on every
request, so spans generated by loadr correlate with traces in
your backend (Jaeger, Tempo, Honeycomb, ...).

```yaml
defaults:
  http:
    tracing: true
```

A fresh `traceparent` (`00-<32-hex trace-id>-<16-hex span-id>-01`) is generated
**per request**. The trace ids only need to be unique, not cryptographically
random, so they are produced from a fast per-VU PRNG. If a request already
carries a `traceparent` header (set on the request or in `defaults.http.headers`),
loadr leaves it untouched.

## Wire-level debugging

For a verbose dump of every HTTP request and response — request line, all
headers, and a preview of the response body (first 2000 chars) — enable HTTP
debug. This is for diagnosing a single test interactively, not for load runs.

```bash
loadr run test.yaml --http-debug
```

The `--http-debug` flag sets the `LOADR_HTTP_DEBUG` environment variable, which
the HTTP handler reads on startup; setting `LOADR_HTTP_DEBUG` directly has the
same effect:

```bash
LOADR_HTTP_DEBUG=1 loadr run test.yaml
```

Output is logged under the `loadr::http_debug` target. Combined with
`cache: true`, the logged responses also show the `cache` state (`hit` /
`revalidated` / `miss`) for each GET.
